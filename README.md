# react-connect-4
A simple React/JS Connect-4 browser game.

All of the main JavaScript is in the src/components directory.
All of the game logic, as well as the game board array, is in the GameBoard class.

Future plans:

Animate the blocks falling down into place instead of simply appearing.
Create a simple computer AI to play as Player 2.
